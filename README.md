> This repo contains my result of a code challenge I did in one of my past lives. A functional basket had to be built **without front-end frameworks** (so just barebones HTML, CSS & JavaScript), **within 4 hours** (I spent 2h 50m), and had to adhere to various requirements (sell certain fruits with certain discounts, etc).
